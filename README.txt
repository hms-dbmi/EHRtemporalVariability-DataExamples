The National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS), which was conducted annually from 1965-2010, was a national probability survey designed to meet the need for information on characteristics of inpatients discharged from non-Federal short-stay hospitals in the United States. Data from the NHDS are available annually and are used to examine important topics of interest in public health and for a variety of activities by governmental, scientific, academic, and commercial institutions. The original NHDS data is publicly available at https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhds/index.htm. The files nhdsSubset.csv and nhdsSubset_wighGap.csv contain a random subset of the NHDS dataset from a total of 3,257,718 hospital discharges between 2000 and 2010.
